# coderefactor

The first homework of the class is on refactoring.

## Semantic Tags

I changed all div tags to semantic tags. This allows my code to be more accessible and organized. I adjusted the CSS tags to reflect the new semantic tags to ensure the look of the page did not change.

## Accessibility

In addition to adding sematic tags to assist screenreaders. I also added alt images to the page and gave it a proper title.

## Neatness

I added comments before sections and removed additional closing tags from self closing tags. I also consolidated classes for sections that would have the same CSS format. This allowed me to remove the repetition from the CSS file.
